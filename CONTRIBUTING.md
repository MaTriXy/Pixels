# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in **Pixels**. Before you begin, make sure to read the guidelines listed below.

- Familiarize yourself with the app's [architecture](https://github.com/worker8/Pixels/wiki/Architecture-Explanation)
- For architectural change or new features, please open up an issue to discuss the change before sending a pull request.
- For making smaller change or fix, opening a pull request directly should be fine. If you wish you to work on an [existing issue](https://github.com/worker8/Pixels/issues), leave a comment to let others know that you intend to work on it.
- Follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code consistent and easier to maintain. 
- Try to add a few test cases for your changes.
